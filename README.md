Recently have learned to set checks using isdigit command in python
```python
firstNumber = input("Hello! Please enter the first Number you would like. ")
secondNumber = input("Alrighty; Next Number please! ")
thirdNumber = input("And finally, the last Number! ")

if firstNumber.isdigit() and secondNumber.isdigit() and thirdNumber.isdigit():
  firstNumber = int(firstNumber)
  secondNumber = int(secondNumber)
  thirdNumber = int(thirdNumber)
else:
  print("So you really thought you could break my code? Get yo goofy outta here")
```
